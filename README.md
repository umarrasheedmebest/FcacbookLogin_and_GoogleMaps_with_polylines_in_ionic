# FcacbookLogin_and_GoogleMaps_with_polylines_in_ionic
Social Login and google maps with markers and polylines

Note:
I will not recommend ionic for this type of application, the reason is location plugins sometimes not work correctly and different device have different issues like geolocation plugin not give correct location it gives with difference of 50meters or might be more or less.
For such type of application i will recommend Native Android or IOS. not any other like reactNative, Flutter etc...
